# RGtodU #
This repository contains the Android Studio project for the RGtodU app.

There are different versions of the app, providing examples of different expectations for different grades.

These are stored in different branches:
- Basic, showing the design of the app with implementation of a single screen.
- Multi-screen, showing a similar design, but this time with an implementation that includes three different pages.
